                <p>I'm a full-stack developer with over 3 years of experience. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development. I specialise in React and Next.js for building dynamic, high-performance user interfaces, while also leveraging back-end technologies like Node.js, Java, and PHP to create robust, scalable full-stack solutions.</p>
                <p>Beyond full-stack development, Iâ€™m passionate about digital marketing. I enjoy leveraging SEO, content strategy, and analytics to enhance online visibility and user engagement. My technical background helps me integrate marketing automation and build performance-driven solutions.
